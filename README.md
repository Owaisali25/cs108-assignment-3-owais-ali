- `Owais_Ali_CS_108_assignment_3.pdf`  
  Full written answers to all questions (Q1–Q10).

- Any additional supporting files (if applicable), for example:
  - `Q6_gridworld_value_iteration.xlsx` or `.ipynb` – calculations for the gridworld question.  
  - `figures/` – diagrams used in the report.

  Logical reasoning, RL basics, agents, POMDP/MDP, edge/fog concepts.

- **Q2 – Real-World Industry Challenges**  
  Annotation bottleneck in medical imaging, latency in Smart City IoT, credential leak analysis.

- **Q3 – FOL → CNF**  
  Translation of English statements into first-order logic and conversion to CNF.

- **Q4 – FOL Conceptual Reasoning**  
  Entailment, certainty, and consistency over a small knowledge base.

- **Q5 – RL Scenario Identification**  
  Defining states, actions, rewards and MDP/POMDP type for thermostat, robot arm and customer support agent.

- **Q6 – Gridworld Value Iteration**  
  3×3 grid, terminal rewards (+4, −4), γ = 0.9; three iterations of value iteration with updated V(s).

- **Q7 – Perception Design**  
  Night-time drone detection of illegal fishing boats; conveyor-belt defect detection system.

- **Q8 – Deployment Architecture**  
  Hybrid edge–cloud design for an autonomous farm robot (latency, privacy, offline operation).
